# CreditPrediction

This project was part of my project during my Virtual Internship Experience at Home Credit as well as my final project for my data science Bootcamp at Dibimbing.id. The goal of the project is to make a model that would easily help Home Credit to make decision on giving credit to customer. 

In a short story, I did a feature selection using Random Forrest Classifier which is the same proposed solution given by Evander et.al. The project reference could be access trough this link:

In conclusion, this is my model evaluation: 
1. AUC Score of 0.98 
2. KS Score of 0.886
3. It predict customer with payment difficulties really well (Precision 0.98)
